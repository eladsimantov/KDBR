function [Q] = inverse_kins(X,elbows)
%INVERSE_KIN is a function to deal with a matrix of points and return a
%matrix of joint variables. It uses the simple inverse_kin function within.
%   X - Matrix of row position vectors of the tool.
%   elbows â€“ Vector of decision values for the solutions in all times.
